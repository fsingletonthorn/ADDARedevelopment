So, today we're going to talk about Confirmatory factor analysis and SEM - structural equation modeling

First I'll give you a super super quick into to confirmatory factor analysis in an SEM framework, and then show you how to run models in AMOS - a SEM tool that will remind you of the late 90s but which is a pretty powerful program for visualizing and running structural equation models


For today, we're going to think about SEM as more or less a mash up of factor analysis and regression ~ which is only approximately correct, and we'll give you a more technically correct definition next week.

First it's important to think about the notation we'll be using 

Squares / rectangles = observed variables
Ellipses = unobserved variables 
Circles = unobserved error terms
regression coefficients are represented with arrows 
correlation coefficients are represented with double headed curves 


Lets think quickly of a normal
